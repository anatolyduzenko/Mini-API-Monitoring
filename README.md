## Overview
This API Monitoring Laravel App helps track API performance, availability, and response times. It provides insights into API health, error rates, and latency issues, ensuring better system reliability.

## Features
- **API Health Checks**: Monitors API uptime and response times.
- **Error Logging**: Captures and logs API failures.
- **Notifications**: Sends alerts when API downtime is detected.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks response times and status codes.
- **Authentication**: Secure access to monitoring reports.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 12
- MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Redis (for queue and caching)
- Supervisor (for background job management)
